    The Art of Doing Absolutely Nothing
  </include>
  <div>
    <p>
      Have you ever tried doing absolutely nothing? It's harder than it sounds. You sit on your couch, determined to be as productive as a potato, and suddenly your brain decides it's the perfect time to remember that embarrassing thing you did in third grade.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align:center; margin: 2em 0;">
      <img src="/images/test.jpg" alt="Test image" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 2px 12px #0001;" />
      <div style="color: #888; font-size: 0.95em; margin-top: 0.5em;">A perfect illustration of doing nothing (or maybe just a test image).</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Experts say doing nothing is good for creativity. Personally, I think it's just a great way to become a world-class daydreamer. Yesterday, I spent an hour imagining what my cat would say if she could talk. Spoiler: she would probably just ask for more snacks.

      So next time someone asks what you're up to, just say, "I'm practicing the fine art of nothingness." Who knows, you might start a trend. Or at least, finally win a staring contest with your ceiling.

      Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a very important appointment with my favorite chair and a cup of tea. Cheers!
